Welcome! This repository stores a set of test assignments for Java practice, which were received as a homework while attending courses from the TMS programming school. In the description of some tasks, there is a problem in the form of a broken encoding. Also, starting from lesson 13 to lesson 19 (Core lvl), the school did not provide homework , so these folders will be replenished when I have time to do this. Starting from the 20th lesson, we began our acquaintance with JavaWeb, for which homework was also not provided.
